        <h3 class="lb_heading">Brazil</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">

            The Brazil national football team (Portuguese: Seleção Brasileira de Futebol), nicknamed Seleção Canarinho (‘Canary Squad’, after their bright yellow jersey), represents Brazil in men's international football and is administered by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), the governing body for football in Brazil. They have been a member of FIFA since 1923 and a member of CONMEBOL since 1916.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">

            Brazil is the most successful national team in the FIFA World Cup, being crowned winner five times: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002. The Seleção also has the best overall performance in the World Cup competition, both in proportional and absolute terms, with a record of 73 victories in 109 matches played, 124 goal difference, 237 points, and 18 losses.[13][14] It is the only national team to have played in all World Cup editions without any absence nor need for playoffs,[15] and the only team to have won the World Cup in four different continents: once in Europe (1958 Sweden), once in South America (1962 Chile), twice in North America (1970 Mexico and 1994 United States), and once in Asia (2002 Korea/Japan). Brazil is also the most successful team in the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, winning it four times, in 1997, 2005, 2009, and 2013.

        <p class="lb_text">

            The Canada men's national soccer team (French: Équipe du Canada de soccer masculin) has represented Canada in international soccer competitions since 1924. The Canadian Soccer Association, the governing body for soccer in Canada, oversees them. They have been a member of FIFA since 1948 and a member of CONCACAF since 1961.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">

            Their most significant achievements are winning the 1985 CONCACAF Championship to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup to qualify for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Canada is the only national team to win a Gold Cup aside from regional powerhouses Mexico and the United States. Canada also won a gold medal in the 1904 Summer Olympics.
            Canada participated in its second World Cup in 2022 and will co-host, along with the United States and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
